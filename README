# Project Portfolio

The front-end code for my current portfolio deployed at [https://www.lisavinson.com](https://www.lisavinson.com). 
The backend code for my portfolio can be viewed [here](https://github.com/LiVinson/portfolio-backend).

## About

The goal of this application was to create a portfolio that showcases my current skillset, especially front end abilities.
I also wanted a site that would be easy to update as I continue to build more projects.

## Tools and Technology 

As much as possible, I wanted to go back to the basics with this project. As much as I love the latest and greatest technology, I wanted my portfolio to be a demonstration
of my fundamental design and development skills 

* HTML5
* SCSS
* JavaScript
* Webpack
* Express (To serve resources after build)

## Contributions
