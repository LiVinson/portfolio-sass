# Personal Portfolio

The front-end code for my current portfolio deployed at [https://www.lisavinson.com](https://www.lisavinson.com).

## About 📝

The goal of this application was to create a portfolio that showcases my current skillset, especially front end abilities. I also wanted a site that would be easy to update as I continue to build more projects.
